## Topic & Goal

We always receive emails regarding Crime Alert from Public Safety of Columbia University and safety definitely is our top priority. Thus, today we want to focus on the topics about Crime in New York City.

We are interested in if the crime rate depends on borough(Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island).Thus, we can know where is relatively safe to live and which area should be paid attention to when we walk in. Also, we want to study if there is a relationship between gender and certain crime types and if the time that the crime happened played an important role. Maybe we have to be especially careful at night than in daytime.

Crime is usually refered as action that constitutes an offense that is punishable by law. We always use the crime rate in a certain area to measure the safety level for that area. The common types of crime are assault, theft, rape, kidnapping and robbery. Researching on crime can help us to know it better and further prevents us from it.
