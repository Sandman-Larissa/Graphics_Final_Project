## I. Data Introduction

We always receive emails regarding Crime Alert from Public Safety of Columbia University and safety definitely is our top priority. Thus, today we want to focus on the topics about Crime in New York City.

We are interested in if the crime rate depends on borough(Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island).Thus, we can know where is relatively safe to live and which area should be paid attention to when we walk in. Also, we want to study if there is a relationship between gender and certain crime types and if the time that the crime happened played an important role. Maybe we have to be especially careful at night than in daytime.

Crime is usually refered as action that constitutes an offense that is punishable by law. We always use the crime rate in a certain area to measure the safety level for that area. The common types of crime are assault, theft, rape, kidnapping and robbery. Researching on crime can help us to know it better and further prevents us from it.


## II. Description of the Data Source

### II.i Data Source

The data is published by NYC Open Data. The source link is: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243?category=Public-Safety&view_name=NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-. It's provided by New York City Police Department (NYPD).

This is a breakdown of every criminal complaint report filed in NYC by the NYPD from 2016 to 2018. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning. Each record represents a criminal complaint in NYC and includes information abot the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to victim and suspect demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of criminal activity. 

There are some other optinal dataset regarding to NYC crime, like CrimeReport(https://www.crimereports.com) or some other data published by NYC Open Data. As most of other datasets are based on this one, and the source of it is the most official，we finally chose it. 

### II.ii Basic Information about Column Variables

### II.iii Number of Records

```{r}
dim(data_raw)
```

Data has 464065 records and 35 features.

### II.iv Issues about the Data

Here are some issues about the data should be concerned or handled:

1. Information is accurate as of the date it was queried from the system of record, but should be considered a close approximation of current records, due to complaint revisions and updates.

2. Null values appearing frequently in certain fields may be attributed to changes on official department forms where data was previously not collected. Null values may also appear in instances where information was not available or unknown at the time of the report and should be considered as either “Unknown/Not Available/Not Reported.” We will analysis all the missing value in Part IV.

3. Crime complaints which involve multiple offenses are classified according to the most serious offense. Attempted crimes are recorded regardless of whether or not the criminal act was successful, except in the instance of Attempted Murder, which is recorded as Felony Assault.

4. There are usually three timestamps: *CMPLNT_FR_DT*, *CMPLNT_TO_DT*, *RPT_DT* are recorded for one complaint. When a complaint contains only a From Datetime, this represents the exact datetime when the crime incident was reported to occur. In the event a complaint has both a From Datetime and a To Datetime, a time range (rather than an exact time) was specified for the occurrence of the crime. In rare cases, records containing only a To Datetime indicate only a known endpoint to the crime.

5. To further protect victim identities, rape and sex crime offenses have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence. Many other offenses that were not able to be geo-coded (for example, due to an invalid address) have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence. This means that we cannot obtain the exact incident site for this kind of offenses.

6. Errors in data transcription may result in nominal data inconsistencies. We will check this kind of errors in Part III.

7. Some mala prohibita offenses do not require a complaint report and may not be represented accurately, or at all, in this dataset. These incidents are generally tracked using other Department forms, including arrests and summonses. These include (but are not limited to) certain drug, trespassing, theft of service, and prostitution offenses. And only valid complaints are included in this release. So the number of records contained in the data tends to be less than that of the crime in reality.

Please refer to the attached data files like footnotes for additional information about this dataset. These files can be found under the folder `Data/raw/`. https://github.com/Sandman-Larissa/Graphics_Final_Project/tree/master/Data/raw

## III. Description of data import / cleaning / transformation

There are some features that have repetitive information such as column **ADDR_PCT_CD** is the precinct in which the incident occurred and we've alreay have enough information about the location that the incident occurred, so we do not need it. Same thing for columns **X_COORD_CD** and **Y_COORD_CD**, we will just use latitude and longitude to locate the accurate position.

There are also some features that is irrevelent with what we want to research on such as **STATION_NAME**, **TRANSIT_DISTRICT** and **LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC**.So, we do not need include them.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data_reduction <- data_raw %>%
  select(-c(ADDR_PCT_CD, LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC, STATION_NAME, TRANSIT_DISTRICT, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD))
head(data_reduction, 1)
```

The feature **KY_CD** and feature **OFNS_DESC** should be paired correspondingly, but we find some conflicts inside it such as below and the categories for OFNS_DESC is too specific.

```{r}
data_reduction[data_reduction$KY_CD==120, ]%>%
  group_by(KY_CD, OFNS_DESC) %>%
  summarize()
data_reduction[data_reduction$KY_CD==345, ]%>%
  group_by(KY_CD, OFNS_DESC) %>%
  summarize()
```

```{r results='hide'}
levels(data_reduction$OFNS_DESC)
```

We are going to add a new column **OFNS_DESC_NEW** that recategorize **OFNS_DESC** into more general categories and delete column **KY_CD**.

By the way, if you are interested in a particular crime type and do not know what is the meaning of it, you can check the website: http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/.

There are some unreasonable values in columns **SUSP_AGE_GROUP**, **SUSP_SEX**, **VIC_AGE_GROUP**, **VIC_RACE**, **VIC_SEX** such as negative values in age, we decide to set them all to missing values.

Finally, we only want to research on data from 2016-2018 since the crime information before 2016 is kind of out of date and maybe not useful for our research. After these cleaning and tidying, we still have 396675 records and 29 features.

```{r}
data_reduction$CMPLNT_FR_DT <- as.Date(as.character(data_reduction$CMPLNT_FR_DT), "%m/%d/%Y")
data_reduction$CMPLNT_TO_DT <- as.Date(as.character(data_reduction$CMPLNT_TO_DT), "%m/%d/%Y")
data_reduction <- data_reduction %>%
  filter(CMPLNT_FR_DT > "2016-01-01" & CMPLNT_FR_DT <"2018-12-31")%>%
